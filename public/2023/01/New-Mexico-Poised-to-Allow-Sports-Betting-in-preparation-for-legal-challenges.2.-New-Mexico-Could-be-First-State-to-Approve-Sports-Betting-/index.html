New Mexico Could be First State to Approve Sports Betting</h1><ol start="3">
<li><p>New Mexico Poised to Allow Sports Betting</p>
</li>
<li><p>New Mexico Could be the First State to Approve Sports Betting</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>New Mexico is inching closer to becoming the first state to allow sports betting in anticipation of possible legal challenges, reports say. </p>
<p>The state’s Gaming Control Board is considering a proposal that would allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting, with the possibility that mobile betting would also be allowed in the future.</p>
<p>The proposal is seen as a way for New Mexico to get ahead of any potential legal challenges related to the current federal prohibition on sports betting. Several states have already started allowing sports betting in anticipation of a potential change in federal law, but no state has gone as far as approving it outright. </p>
<p>Such a move could put New Mexico at risk of being sued by the major professional sports leagues, which are adamantly opposed to legalized sports betting. But gambling regulators are hopeful that the leagues will ultimately choose not to sue a smaller state like New Mexico, instead focusing their efforts on larger states with more lucrative markets. </p>
<p>If approved, sports betting would likely be available in New Mexico casinos by early 2019.</p>
<h1 id="3-New-Mexico-Sports-Betting-Legislation-Introduced"><a href="#3-New-Mexico-Sports-Betting-Legislation-Introduced" class="headerlink" title="3. New Mexico Sports Betting Legislation Introduced"></a>3. New Mexico Sports Betting Legislation Introduced</h1><p>New Mexico introduced new sports betting legislation on Jan. 10, 2019. The proposed bill, SB 577, would legalize sports betting in the state. </p>
<p>The proposed bill would allow for sports betting at casinos, racetracks and tribal gaming facilities. It would also allow for mobile and online sports betting. New Mexico residents would be able to place bets on professional and college sports, including basketball, football, baseball and ice hockey. </p>
<p>New Mexico is one of many states that are considering legalizing sports betting in response to the Supreme Court’s decision in May 2018 to overturn the federal ban on sports betting. Delaware, Mississippi and West Virginia have already legalized sports betting since the decision. </p>
<p>Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has said she is open to legalizing sports betting in New Mexico. “I am supportive of it if it can be done responsibly and there are adequate consumer protections in place,” she said. </p>
<p>The proposed bill has faced opposition from some lawmakers who argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other negative consequences. “We don’t want to create another epidemic or addictive behavior in our state,” said Rep. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces). </p>
<p>Others argue that legalization would generate revenue for the state that could be used to fund education and other important programs. “It’s something we should consider because there is potential revenue that we can bring in for our state,” said Sen. Jerry Ortiz y Pino (D-Albuquerque). </p>
<p>The proposed bill is currently being considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>
<h1 id="4-New-Mexico-readies-for-sports-betting-as-neighbor-Colorado-moves-forward"><a href="#4-New-Mexico-readies-for-sports-betting-as-neighbor-Colorado-moves-forward" class="headerlink" title="4. New Mexico readies for sports betting as neighbor Colorado moves forward"></a>4. New Mexico readies for sports betting as neighbor Colorado moves forward</h1><p>New Mexico is getting ready to allow sports betting just as its neighbor Colorado moves ahead with regulations for the activity. The New Mexico Gaming Control Board is considering an array of regulations for sports betting, including how much operators can charge for bets and which sports are included.</p>
<p>Colorado is one of eight states that has already begun regulating sports betting in anticipation of a possible U.S. Supreme Court ruling that could overturn a federal ban on the practice. That ruling could come as soon as next month.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any question that New Mexico will follow Colorado and be one of the early states to offer regulated sports betting,” said John attended, a gaming attorney with Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The potential for legalized sports betting in New Mexico has drawn interest from several operators, including casino giant Caesars Entertainment Corp., which is planning a $22 million renovation of the Santa Ana Star Casino in Bernalillo County that would include a sportsbook.</p>
<p>State Sen. George Munoz, D-Gallup, said he expects operators to begin ramping up their lobbying efforts now that it appears legalization is imminent.</p>
<p>Munoz has sponsored a bill that would allow tribes and racetracks to offer sports betting and has already started discussions with stakeholders about the best way to implement it. He expects a vote on the bill in the Legislature sometime this year.</p>
<p>“It’s something that we need to do because our neighboring state is doing it, and we’re losing out on revenue,” Munoz said.</p>
<h1 id="5-New-Mexico-legislators-discuss-legalizing-sports-betting"><a href="#5-New-Mexico-legislators-discuss-legalizing-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="5. New Mexico legislators discuss legalizing sports betting"></a>5. New Mexico legislators discuss legalizing sports betting</h1><p>New Mexico is one of the states that does not have any legalized sports betting. This could change soon, as legislators are now discussing the possibility of legalizing it. There are many proponents of this idea, as it would bring in additional revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Rebecca Dow is one of the legislators who is in favor of legalizing sports betting. She believes that it would be a great way to generate revenue for the state. New Mexico currently has a budget shortfall of $69 million, so any additional revenue would be welcome.</p>
<p>There are also many people who support sports betting on moral grounds. They believe that it is wrong to prohibit people from engaging in this activity, especially when other forms of gambling are legal. They argue that sports betting should be treated in the same way as other forms of gambling, such as casino games and lotteries.</p>
<p>Others believe that legalizing sports betting would lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates. They argue that this type of gambling is particularly addictive, and that it can be hard to stop once you start. Gambling addiction can have devastating consequences for individuals and their families.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, there is growing momentum behind the idea of legalizing sports betting in New Mexico. If the legislature does decide to move forward with this proposal, it is likely that there will be a significant battle over the details. There are many different interests at stake, and it will be up to the lawmakers to find a solution that works for everyone.</p>
