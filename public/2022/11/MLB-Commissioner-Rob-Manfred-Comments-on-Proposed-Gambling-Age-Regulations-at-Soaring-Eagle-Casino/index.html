      		<h1 id="MLB-Commissioner-Rob-Manfred-Comments-on-Proposed-Gambling-Age-Regulations-at-Soaring-Eagle-Casino"><a href="#MLB-Commissioner-Rob-Manfred-Comments-on-Proposed-Gambling-Age-Regulations-at-Soaring-Eagle-Casino" class="headerlink" title="MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred Comments on Proposed Gambling Age Regulations at Soaring Eagle Casino"></a>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred Comments on Proposed Gambling Age Regulations at Soaring Eagle Casino</h1><p>Commissioner Rob Manfred of Major League Baseball gave a statement today at the Soaring Eagle Casino in Mount Pleasant, Michigan regarding the league’s proposal to raise the minimum gambling age from 18 to 21.</p>
<p>“I want to make it clear that our proposal is not about preventing fans from gambling on baseball,” Manfred said. “It’s about protecting our young people from the dangers associated with gambling. The research is clear: gambling can have harmful consequences for young people, and we need to do everything we can to protect them.”</p>
<p>Manfred noted that other professional sports leagues, including the NFL and NBA, have raised their minimum gambling ages in recent years.</p>
<p>“We believe that this proposal is in the best interests of our fans and our players,” Manfred said. “And we hope that the state of Michigan will join us in supporting this important initiative.”</p>
<h1 id="Soaring-Eagle-Casino-in-Michigan-Pushes-to-Raise-Gambling-Age-Limit-to-21"><a href="#Soaring-Eagle-Casino-in-Michigan-Pushes-to-Raise-Gambling-Age-Limit-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Soaring Eagle Casino in Michigan Pushes to Raise Gambling Age Limit to 21"></a>Soaring Eagle Casino in Michigan Pushes to Raise Gambling Age Limit to 21</h1><p>In the state of Michigan, there is a casino that is pushing to have the legal gambling age limit raised from 18 to 21. The Soaring Eagle Casino is located in Mount Pleasant and they have been lobbying state lawmakers to make this change. This casino is hoping to set an example for the rest of the casinos in the state, as well as keep their younger customers safe.</p>
<p>Detroit’s other casinos are also in favor of this change, as they feel it would help them keep their own gambling age limits at 21 instead of 18. The MGM Grand Detroit Casino and Greektown Casino-Hotel are both on board with this proposal. The lobby group representing all of Detroit’s casinos, the Michigan Gaming Industry Association, feels that this would be a good move for the state.</p>
<p>There has been some pushback against this proposal, as there are many people who believe that 18 year olds should be able to make their own decisions about whether or not they want to gamble. There are also concerns that this could lead to other age restrictions being put into place and could begin a slippery slope when it comes to limiting what people can do at a younger age.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no movement on changing the gambling age limit in Michigan and it is unclear if anything will happen in the near future.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-Pushes-Back-Against-Proposed-Change-in-Gambling-Age-at-Soaring-Eagle-Casino"><a href="#MLB-Pushes-Back-Against-Proposed-Change-in-Gambling-Age-at-Soaring-Eagle-Casino" class="headerlink" title="MLB Pushes Back Against Proposed Change in Gambling Age at Soaring Eagle Casino"></a>MLB Pushes Back Against Proposed Change in Gambling Age at Soaring Eagle Casino</h1><p>The proposed change in the gambling age at Soaring Eagle Casino from 18 to 21 years of age has caught the attention of the MLB. Officials from the league have voiced their opposition to the proposed change, stating that it would negatively impact their ability to protect the integrity of the game.</p>
<p>According to MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, “It is important that we protect young people, especially those who are most vulnerable, from harm. This includes protecting them from addictive activities like gambling.” Manfred also expressed his concern that a younger age group would be more easily manipulated by those looking to fix games.</p>
<p>The owners of Soaring Eagle Casino insist that they are not trying to exploit minors, but simply want to offer them an opportunity to gamble at an earlier age. They argue that 18 is the legal age for other forms of gambling and that there is no reason why casino gaming should be any different.</p>
<p>MLB officials met with representatives from Soaring Eagle Casino on Wednesday in an effort to reach a compromise on the issue, but no agreement was reached. The matter is expected to come before the state legislature later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Rising-Opposition-to-Proposed-Gambling-Age-Limit-at-Soaring-Eagle-Casino-in-Michigan"><a href="#Rising-Opposition-to-Proposed-Gambling-Age-Limit-at-Soaring-Eagle-Casino-in-Michigan" class="headerlink" title="Rising Opposition to Proposed Gambling Age Limit at Soaring Eagle Casino in Michigan"></a>Rising Opposition to Proposed Gambling Age Limit at Soaring Eagle Casino in Michigan</h1><p>The proposed gambling age limit at Soaring Eagle Casino in Michigan is facing rising opposition. The new limit would restrict those under the age of 21 from gambling, but some are concerned that it would have a negative impact on the casino’s revenue.</p>
<p>Those in favor of the proposed limit say that it would help protect vulnerable young people from developing a gambling addiction. They also argue that it would be more responsible to restrict those under the age of 21 from gambling, as they are not legally considered adults in Michigan.</p>
<p>However, those opposed to the proposed limit argue that it would discourage younger people from visiting the casino, resulting in a loss of revenue. They also claim that most young people are responsible when it comes to gambling and don’t need to be restricted from enjoying this activity.</p>
<p>The proposal to increase the gambling age limit is currently being debated by the state legislature. If passed, it would go into effect on March 31st, 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Soaring-Eagle-Casino-Defends-Plan-to-Raise-Minimum-Gambling-Age-to-21"><a href="#Soaring-Eagle-Casino-Defends-Plan-to-Raise-Minimum-Gambling-Age-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Soaring Eagle Casino Defends Plan to Raise Minimum Gambling Age to 21"></a>Soaring Eagle Casino Defends Plan to Raise Minimum Gambling Age to 21</h1><p>Michigan’s Soaring Eagle Casino is facing backlash after announcing their plans to raise the minimum gambling age from 18 to 21. The casino says the change is necessary to protect vulnerable young people, but many members of the community argue that it will simply force gambling activity underground.</p>
<p>Soaring Eagle Casino released a statement saying, “We are committed to protecting our guests and ensuring that all forms of entertainment are enjoyed in a responsible and safe manner. By raising the minimum gambling age to 21, we can help prevent vulnerable young people from developing addictive behaviors while also meeting industry best practices.”</p>
<p>However, many members of the community see things differently. “This is just going to push gambling underground, where it will be even more dangerous,” said one concerned citizen. Another argued, “If you’re old enough to vote or buy alcohol, you should be old enough to gamble. It’s not like it’s some life-or-death decision.”</p>
<p>Soaring Eagle Casino has been open since 1999 and employs over 2,000 people. The casino is one of the largest in Michigan, with over 100,000 square feet of gaming space.</p>
