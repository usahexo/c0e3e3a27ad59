<h1 id="How-to-Play-and-Earn-at-Blackjack-in-Guatemala"><a href="#How-to-Play-and-Earn-at-Blackjack-in-Guatemala" class="headerlink" title="How to Play and Earn at Blackjack in Guatemala"></a>How to Play and Earn at Blackjack in Guatemala</h1><p>As a foreigner, you may find that the casinos in Guatemala offer good opportunities to make some money. Blackjack is one of the games that is most commonly offered, and it is one that you can play quite well if you understand the basics.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand about blackjack is that the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. You are trying to beat the dealer, who also has 21 as their goal. If you have a higher total than the dealer, you win. If your total is lower, you lose.</p>
<p>One important thing to note about blackjack is that you can only bust if your first two cards total 22 or more. If your first two cards are an ace and a 10, for example, your total would be 21 but you would not bust. As long as your first two cards add up to less than 22, you cannot bust.</p>
<p>When playing blackjack in Guatemala, there are a few things to keep in mind in order to improve your chances of winning. First, always take insurance when the dealer has an ace showing. This will protect you against losing if the dealer gets a blackjack. Second, always stand on 17 or higher. Third, double down on 11 or 12 and split pairs when possible. Following these tips will give you a better chance of winning at blackjack in Guatemala casinos.</p>
