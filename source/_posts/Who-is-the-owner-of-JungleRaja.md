#  Who is the owner of JungleRaja?

In November of 2016, JungleRaja was acquired by the investment firm, Accel Partners. This decision made JungleRaja one of the few ecommerce companies in India to receive investment from a top-tier venture capitalist.

JungleRaja began as an online store that focused on selling eco-friendly and sustainable products. It started out as a small startup in 2013, but it has quickly become one of the leading online retailers in India. JungleRaja’s founders are passionate about making a difference in the world, and they want to make it easier for others to do the same.

This commitment to sustainability is what led JungleRaja to team up with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 2016. The two organizations partnered up to create a campaign called “Reduce Your Footprint”. The goal of this campaign is to raise awareness about climate change and how everyone can take steps to reduce their environmental impact.

The partnership with UNEP has been a major success for JungleRaja. In just a few months, the company has been able to reach over 1 million people with its sustainability message. And it shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.

With its commitment to sustainability and its partnership with UNEP, JungleRaja is quickly becoming one of the most responsible and innovative ecommerce companies in India.

#  How did the team end up in Washington?

A few weeks ago, the Washington Capitals team surprisingly won their first-ever Stanley Cup championship. The players and fans were overjoyed. But how did the team end up in Washington in the first place?

The Capitals were founded in 1974 as an expansion team. At that time, there was no National Hockey League (NHL) team in Washington, so the new Capitals franchise represented the entire state of Virginia. The team’s first home arena was the Baltimore Civic Center, which was located about an hour away from Washington.

In 1987, the Capitals moved to a new home arena in Landover, Maryland, which is just outside of Washington. The team played there until 1997, when they moved back to the city of Washington. They have been playing at the Verizon Center (formerly known as the MCI Center) ever since.

The Capitals have had some good teams over the years, but they have never been able to win a Stanley Cup championship until now. In fact, they had never even made it to the Stanley Cup Finals until this year. Many people were surprised when they won the championship series against the Vegas Golden Knights in five games.

But now that they have won it all, the Capitals are sure to be remembered as one of the greatest teams in NHL history. And their fans will always remember where they came from – Virginia!
