#  Who Regulates Online Gambling in the US? Microgaming (Foxium)!

There are many misconceptions about the legality of online gambling in the US. The fact is that there are several different entities that regulate different aspects of online gambling in the US. This can be a bit confusing for players, so let's break it down.

The first layer of regulation is at the federal level. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for prosecuting violations of the federal laws that apply to online gambling. These laws are mostly focused on preventing financial institutions from processing payments for illegal gambling activities.

The second layer of regulation is at the state level. Each state has its own laws and regulations regarding online gambling. Some states have specific laws that apply only to online gambling, while others simply use their existing gambling laws to cover online activities.

The third layer of regulation is at the tribal level. Indian tribes are sovereign nations with their own set of laws governing casino operations on tribal lands. Many tribes operate their own online casinos, and they are subject to their own regulations.

So who regulates online gambling in the US? The answer is: everyone! The DOJ, state governments, and tribal nations all have a role in regulating various aspects of online gambling. This can be a bit confusing for players, but it ultimately ensures that online gambling is legal in most parts of the country.
