#  Thor 2 Game Closing Time Announced!

The Thor 2 game is set to close on December 17th of this year, according to an official post from the developers. This closure will impact all versions of the game, including PC, mobile, and console.

In their statement, the developers said that they had made the decision in order to "shift our focus and resources to other projects." They also thanked players for their support over the years.

The Thor 2 game was first released in 2013, and it has remained popular among fans of action RPGs since then. Players will have just a few months left to enjoy the title before it shuts down for good.

#  The Thor 2 Game is Closing Soon!

In the world of online games, there are some that come and go, while others stick around for a considerable amount of time. Thor 2 is one of those games that is coming to an end on December 31st, 2017.

The game first launched in 2006 and has been enjoyed by many players over the years. However, due to a number of reasons, the game's developers have made the decision to close it down.

One reason for this may be because the game doesn't generate enough revenue for the developers to keep it running. This could be due to a number of factors such as its age or the rise in popularity of newer and flashier games.

Whatever the reason, players who still want to enjoy Thor 2 have just a few weeks left to do so. The good news is that all players will receive rewards based on their level and loyalty points once the game shuts down. So make sure you log in as often as possible before it's too late!
