#  Club Atletico de Madrid looks to improve on finishing second in La Liga last season 

Club Atletico de Madrid had a fantastic season last year, finishing second in La Liga and reaching the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League. However, they will be looking to improve on that this season and make a run at the league title.

One of their biggest offseason additions was Stefan Savic, who they signed from Italian side AC Milan. Savic is a very experienced defender and should be able to help Atletico solidify their back line. They also added Joao Felix, who is considered to be one of the most promising young players in Europe. Felix has already made an impact in preseason, scoring two goals in a friendly against Juventus.

Atletico Madrid has also been very active in the transfer market this summer, selling some key players such as Antoine Griezmann and Lucas Hernandez. While Griezmann will be difficult to replace, the club has brought in several quality players that should help them compete for trophies this season.

Diego Simeone’s side is definitely one of the favorites to win La Liga this season and they will definitely be a team to watch in the Champions League as well.

#  Club Atletico de Madrid eyes Europa League title after early UEFA Champions League exit 

Club Atletico de Madrid will be looking to win the Europa League title this season after being knocked out of the UEFA Champions League in the group stages.

The Spanish club had high hopes of progressing to the next round of Europe’s elite club competition, but they were unable to pick up any points from their first four games and ultimately finished in third place in Group C, behind AS Roma and Chelsea.

That has resulted in them now having to compete in the Europa League, and they will be hoping to go all the way and lift the trophy this season. They come into the competition as one of the favourites, with some excellent players in their squad such as Antoine Griezmann, Diego Costa and Koke.

Their route to the final is not going to be easy though, with some tough fixtures against teams such as Arsenal and Napoli lying ahead. But if they can get through those games, then they will have a great chance of winning the competition.

Manager Diego Simeone will be hoping that his team can put their disappointment of Champions League exit behind them and focus on winningEurope’s second tier club competition. And with players like Griezmann in their ranks, they certainly have a good chance of doing just that.

#  Club Atletico de Madrid prepares for new season with additions to the squad 

Atlético Madrid has begun their preseason preparations with new coach, Diego Simeone. The team has added new players to the roster in preparation for the new La Liga season.

Atlético Madrid has added goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois from Chelsea, midfielder Mario Suarez from Valencia, and defender Toby Alderweireld from Ajax. Diego Costa and David Villa will also be returning to the club after spending last season on loan at Rayo Vallecano and Atlético Madrid, respectively.

Simeone is looking to build on last season's successes, which saw the team finish 3rd in La Liga and reach the final of the UEFA Champions League. "Our objective is always to improve and compete at the highest level," said Simeone. "We have a very competitive league where it is very difficult to win titles."

The addition of Courtois should give Atlético Madrid a strong chance of winning the league title this season. Courtois won the Premier League Golden Glove award last season as Chelsea's number one goalkeeper. He played an important role in helping Chelsea reach the Champions League final.

Atlético Madrid will also be competing in this year's Copa Del Rey and UEFA Super Cup. They kick off their La Liga campaign on August 18th against Rayo Vallecano.

#  Club Atletico de Madrid looks to continue strong play at Vicente Calderon Stadium 

Club Atletico de Madrid looks to continue their strong play as they return home to the Vicente Calderon Stadium. They will be taking on Eibar, who has had a difficult year so far.

Diego Simeone’s side enters this match in good form, having won three of their last four fixtures across all competitions. They are coming off a 2-1 victory over Deportivo La Coruna, with both goals coming from Antoine Griezmann. The Frenchman currently leads Atletico in scoring with six goals in all competitions.

Eibar, on the other hand, is in relegation trouble. Sitting in 18th place in La Liga, they have just six points from their first nine games. Their only win of the season came against Alaves in late September.

Atletico is favored to win this match and should be able to get the three points at home.

#  Atlético Madrid bets on Antoine Griezmann to lead club in goals this season

With the departure of striker Diego Costa to Chelsea, Atlético Madrid faces the challenge of finding someone to fill the goal-scoring void. Manager Diego Simeone is placing his bet on French forward Antoine Griezmann, who he believes can lead the team in scoring this season.

Griezmann, 25, has shown his scoring prowess in previous seasons for Atlético Madrid. He scored 32 goals in all competitions last season, and was a huge factor in the team’s successful run to the UEFA Champions League final. This season, Griezmann will be looking to lead Atlético Madrid to another championship while filling the goal-scoring hole left by Costa.

Atlético Madrid has been busy in the transfer market this summer, signing several new players to help bolster their squad. However, it will be up to Griezmann to provide the majority of the team’s goals this season. With a strong offensive line behind him, including players like Ángel Correa and Yannick Carrasco, Griezmann should have plenty of opportunities to score goals and help lead Atlético Madrid to victory.
