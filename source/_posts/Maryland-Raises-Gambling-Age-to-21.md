#  Maryland Raises Gambling Age to 21

In an effort to keep youths from gambling, Maryland has raised the gambling age from 18 to 21. The new law is set to take effect on October 1, 2018.

Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for young people, including ruining their financial future, damaging relationships, and impacting their mental health. In Maryland, lawmakers believe that by raising the gambling age, they can help protect youths from these risks.

Many other states have also raised the gambling age in recent years. In some cases, the age has been raised to 21, while in others it has been raised to 25.

Opponents of the new Maryland law argue that it will simply push gambling activity underground, where it will be more difficult to regulate. They also say that 18-year-olds are considered adults in most other areas of life and should be able to make their own decisions about gambling.

In a unanimous vote, the Maryland state legislature has increased the gambling age from 18 to 21. The new law goes into effect on October 1, 2017.

This decision comes as a response to an increase in gambling addiction among young people. According to studies, nearly half of all problem gamblers are under the age of 21.

Maryland is not the first state to raise its gambling age. In fact, 21 is now the national standard for all gambling activities, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting.

Opponents of the measure argue that it will only push young people underground, where they will be more likely to engage in illegal activities such as blackjack and poker. But supporters say that it will help protect vulnerable young people from becoming addicted to gambling.

#  Maryland Increases Gambling Age

In May 2018, the state of Maryland voted to increase the gambling age from 18 to 21. The legislation, which was sponsored by State Delegate Benjamin Kramer, was intended to help protect young people from the dangers of gambling addiction.

The bill passed both the House and Senate unanimously, and Governor Larry Hogan quickly signed it into law. It went into effect on October 1, 2018.

“This is an important step forward in protecting our young people from predatory gambling practices,” Delegate Kramer said in a statement. “By increasing the gambling age to 21, we are ensuring that these activities are only available to adults who can make informed decisions about their gambling habits.”

Opponents of the bill argued that it would lead to underground gambling and black market activities. However, Delegate Kramer dismissed these concerns, noting that 18-year-olds are already able to gamble in other states without any such problems.

Maryland is not the first state to increase its gambling age in recent years. In 2016, both California and Hawaii raised their ages to 21. And last year, Illinois passed a similar law.

#  Gambling Age in Maryland Increased to 21

The Maryland State Senate voted on Wednesday to increase the gambling age from 18 to 21.

The bill, which was proposed by Republican Senator Wayne Norman, would make it illegal for those under 21 to gamble at casinos, racetracks and other gambling facilities in Maryland.

The bill now moves on to the House of Delegates for consideration.

A similar measure was passed by the Senate last year but failed to pass the House.

 Supporters of the bill argue that it will help protect young people from developing gambling addictions.

"It's not a cure-all, but it's one more tool in the toolbox to address an issue that is growing throughout our state and throughout our country," said Norman.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction and criminal activity among young people.

"What you're doing is you're pushing them into a life of criminality," said Del. Brooke Lierman. "You're giving them less opportunity, instead of more opportunity."

#  Maryland's Gambling Age Goes Up to 21

The Maryland General Assembly voted on Wednesday to increase the state's gambling age from 18 to 21.

Governor Larry Hogan has not yet said whether he will sign the bill into law, but many believe that he will given his past support for similar measures.

If the governor does approve the bill, Maryland will become the fifth state in the country to raise its gambling age to 21. The other states are Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, and Oregon.

Proponents of the legislation argue that it will help protect young people from developing addictive behaviors. They also say that it will help to reduce crime rates in Maryland.

Opponents of the measure argue that it will simply push gambling activity underground, where it will be harder to track and regulate. They also claim that young adults who are legally allowed to gamble in other states will simply travel across state lines to do so.
