On Monday, the governor of New Jersey signed a bill into law making sports betting legal in the state. With this new development, businesses are already gearing up to take advantage of the expected influx of business. ratiopharm Ulm, a professional basketball team in Germany, is one such business that is celebrating the news.

The team announced on Tuesday that it will offer free beer to all fans in attendance for its next home game. This promotion is in addition to ticket discounts that the team is already offering. In a statement, the team's owner said that he was "delighted" by the news of NJ's legalization of sports betting and that he hopes it will bring more fans to the games.

#  NJ becomes the first state to legalize sports betting since SCOTUS ruling

Last Monday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill into law legalizing sports betting in the state, making NJ the first state to do so since the Supreme Court’s ruling in May allowed states to legalize sports gambling.

The new law allows casinos and racetracks in NJ to offer sports betting, with Murphy predicting that it would bring in “hundreds of millions of dollars annually” in new revenue. The legislation allows bets on professional and college sports, but not on high school or amateur events.

Sports betting has been available in NJ through unregulated and illegal bookmakers for years, but Monday’s signing makes it the first state to formally legalize and regulate the industry.

Many other states are now exploring similar measures, including West Virginia, which is expected to have a regulatory framework for sports betting in place by July. Connecticut, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania are also considering legalizing sports betting.

Although some oppose legalized sports betting as promoting gambling addiction and other social ills, supporters argue that it can be a valuable source of revenue for states and create jobs in the gaming industry.
