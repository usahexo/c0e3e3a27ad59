#  Texas Holdem Poker – How to Know What Beats What

If you’re new to Texas Holdem poker, the first thing you need to learn is the ranking of hands. This will help you determine which hand is better than the other, and make better decisions while playing.

In Texas Holdem poker, the ranking of hands from highest to lowest is as follows:

1. Royal flush
2. Straight flush
3. Four of a kind
4. Full house
5. Flush
6. Straight
7. Three of a kind
8. Two pair
9. One pair
10. High card

A royal flush is the best possible hand in Texas Holdem poker, and consists of a straight from Ace to Ten, with all five cards of the same suit. A straight flush is next in rank, and is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. Four of a kind is formed by four cards of the same rank, and full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank (for example, 3 kings and 2 queens). Flush is any five cards of the same suit, straight is any five consecutive cards that are not all of the same suit, three-of-a-kind is three cards of the same rank, two pair is two different pairs, and one pair are two cards of the same rank (e.g., 2 aces). The highest card in your hand (not counting kickers) becomes your fifth card if you hit quads or better on the flop – for example if you have A♥ K♥ Q♦ J♣ and hit an ace on the flop, then you would play as if you had A♠ K♠ Q♦ J♣ (since A♥ becomes your fifth card). 

 So what beats what in Texas holdem? 

 Here’s a list from strongest to weakest: 

1) Royal flush  2) Straight flush  3) Four of a kind  4) Full house  5) Flush  6) Straight  7) Three of a kind  8) Two pair  9) One pair 10) High card

#  How to Play Texas Holdem Poker: The Ultimate Guide

Poker is one of the most popular card games in the world, and Texas Holdem is the most popular variant of poker. If you’re looking to learn how to play Texas Holdem Poker, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we will teach you everything you need to know about playing Texas Holdem Poker.

The first thing you need to know about Texas Holdem Poker is the basic rules of the game. The aim of the game is to win all of the chips in the pot by making the best possible five-card poker hand. There are two types of bets that can be made in Texas Holdem – a bet or a raise. A bet is simply a bet put in by a player that is equal to the size of the big blind, while a raise is a bet that is greater than the size of the big blind.

Before any cards are dealt, each player must put in an ante. The player with the lowest card showing starts first and must either put in a bet (equal to the size of the big blind) or fold. The next player then has three options:

1) Put in a bet that is equal to the size of the previous bet;
2) Raise, which means putting in a bet that is greater than the size of the previous bet; or
3) Fold, which means throwing away your hand and forfeiting your ante.

If all players except for one fold, that player automatically wins the pot. If more than one player remains after all players have had their turn, there will be a showdown where each player will SHOW their cards. The player with the best hand wins the pot. Here are some basic winning hands in Texas Holdem Poker:

Royal flush – 10 ♥ J ♥ Q ♥ K ♥ A ♣ (the highest ranking hand)
Straight flush – 5 ♣ 6 ♣ 7 ♣ 8 ♣ 9 ♠ (a five-card sequence all in one suit)
Four of a kind – 3♦ 3♠ 3♥ 3♢ (four cards of same rank)
Full house – K♠ K♦ 2♠ 2♢ (three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank)
Flush – A♥ 2♦ 3♥ 4♠ 5♣ (five cards all from one suit) 
Straight – 4♦ 5♦ 6♦ 7♦ 8♥ (five cards in sequential order but not all from one suit)     Three of a kind – A♦ A♢ 2♥ 2♣ (three cards of same rank)  Two pair – Q♥ Q♦ J♠ J♦ (two different pairs)  One pair – 7♥ 7♦ 6♥ 6♦ (two matching cards) High card – Any other card

#  How to Win at Texas Holdem Poker: Strategies for Every Situation

Texas Holdem is one of the most popular variants of poker, and is played by millions of people around the world. The game can be complicated for beginners, but with a bit of practice and some knowledge of the basic rules and strategies, anyone can become a winning player.

In this article, we'll discuss some common situations you'll encounter during a Texas Holdem game, and give you some tips on how to best play your hand.

The Play Begins

The game begins with each player being dealt two cards face down - these are known as 'hole cards'. The player with the highest-valued card starts the action, and gameplay progresses clockwise around the table. In subsequent rounds, each player is dealt another card face up (known as the 'flop'), followed by another card face down (the 'turn'), then another card face up (the 'river'). The player with the best five-card hand at the end of all these rounds wins the pot.

Note that in Texas Holdem, suits are not used to determine rankings - only card values are considered. For example, an Ace of Spades would rank higher than an Ace of Hearts, but both would rank higher than a Two of any suit.

Basic Strategy for Beginners

If you're just starting out in Texas Holdem, here are some basic tips to help you win more often:

- When you're dealt hole cards, always try to pair them up if possible. This will give you a strong starting hand that is likely to win against most other combinations.


- If there's no pair available, try to get ahold of high-value cards like Aces or Kings. These hands will also be strong contenders against most other combinations.


- In general, it's usually a bad idea to fold unless you have a very weak hand. Try to stay in the game as long as possible so that you can increase your chances of winning the pot.


- Be aware of what's happening at the table - keep track of what cards have been played and make sure you isn't caught bluffing if it's not necessary.



Now that we've covered some basic strategies, let's take a look at some specific situations you might encounter during a game of Texas Holdem: 



 Situation 1: You're holding two low-value cards (e.g Two or Three)

Your best move in this situation is to fold - there's no way you can make a strong hand with these cards and it's unlikely that anyone else at the table will either. Wait for better cards and hope for a better opportunity next time.



 Situation 2: You're holding two high-value cards (e.g Ace or King)
Some players might choose to bet aggressively in this situation - but remember that there are still four other high value cards left in the deck which could beat your hand easily. A safer option would be to call (or even fold) any bets made by others players, and wait for better cards to come out on the flop or turn.

#  Texas Holdem Poker Online: Tips for Playing & Winning

In poker, there are three main variants: Texas Holdem, Omaha and Stud. This article will focus on Texas Holdem, which is the most popular variant. Played with a standard deck of 52 cards, each player is dealt two cards face down - these are their hole cards. The aim of the game is to make the best 5-card hand using any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards on the table. The player who makes the best hand wins the pot.

At a basic level, there are three types of hands in poker - high card, pair or two pairs. In order to make a winning hand, you'll need at least one high card. If you're lucky enough to get two high cards (pair), your chances of winning increase significantly. If you get three of a kind or better, you're almost guaranteed to win!

Even if you don't have any of the above hands, you can still win by playing the odds. For example, if you have four hearts and the board shows two hearts, there's a good chance that another heart will come up on the turn or river and give you a flush - a very strong hand. In general, you should always try to make the best hand possible using the five community cards and your two hole cards.

Now that we've covered the basics, let's take a look at some tips for playing Texas Holdem online:

1) Always play aggressively - in poker, the best way to win is to take as many pots as possible!

2) Play tight in early position - this means folding more often and only playing good hands. In late position (after the blinds), loosen up and start playing more hands.

3) Use position to your advantage - recognize which positions are most powerful and play accordingly. For example, it's much easier to bluff from early position than from late position.

4) Be wary of tricky plays - some players like to use complex betting patterns in an attempt to confuse their opponents. Don't fall for these traps!

5) Know when to fold - sometimes it's better to fold than try and play out a bad hand. Remember: even if you lose a few hands, over time you'll still come out ahead if you play smartly.

If you’re looking to up your Texas Holdem game, it’s important to know the best hands to play. Here are nine of the best:

1. Royal Flush: The highest possible hand in poker, a royal flush consists of a Ten, Jack, Queen, King and Ace of the same suit. This is an unbeatable hand.

4. Full House: A full house is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three Queens and two Kings. This hand is also very strong.

5. Flush: A flush is five cards of the same suit, but not in consecutive order. This hand can be tricky to play, but if you have it, you should go for it!

6. Straight: A straight is five cards in consecutive order, regardless of suit. This is a solid hand that can often take down a pot.

7. Three of a Kind: When you have three cards of the same rank, you have a three of a kind. This hand isn’t as powerful as some others, but it can still win you some big pots!

8. Two Pair: When you have two different pairs, such as two Queens and two Jacks, you have a two pair hand. This isn’t the strongest hand around but it can still take down smaller pots.

9. One Pair: When you have just one pair, such as two Kings, you have a one pair hand. This isn’t the strongest hand out there but it can still be dangerous!
