#  Woman Wins $8Million At Casino – Making Typical Shot Roulette Game Play

A woman from North Carolina became an overnight millionaire at a casino in downtown Las Vegas. She was playing the typical shot roulette game and hit the $8 million jackpot.

This is one of the largest payouts in the history of the casino, and it has brought attention to this game as a potential money-maker.

The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that she has always loved playing shot roulette. She typically plays at a smaller casino in her hometown, but decided to take a trip to Las Vegas and try her luck at one of the big casinos.

She was playing at the Bellagio casino when she hit the jackpot. The machine displayed a message that read “$8,019,152”. At first, she thought it was some sort of mistake, but soon realized that she had in fact won a life-changing sum of money.

She says that she plans to use the money to buy a new house and travel the world. She is also planning on donating some money to charity.

Casino officials say that this is one of their largest payouts ever for a shot roulette game. They are glad that it went to someone who plans to spend it responsibly and enjoy it rather than someone who would blow it all on gambling.

#  86-Year-Old Man Wins $270,000 On Lucky Shot Roulette Game Play 

An 86-year-old man walked away with a cool $270,000 after playing what he claims was only a lucky shot roulette game. The octogenarian pensioner, whose name has not yet been released to the public, was enjoying a weekend away in the gambling city of Monaco when he decided to test his luck at the roulette table. 

After placing a single chip on red and spinning the wheel, the old-timer watched in disbelief as the ball landed on his chosen number. With his winning bet paying out 36 times its value, the delighted pensioner scooped up his prize and left the casino to enjoy the rest of his holiday. 

This is not the first time that an elderly gambler has hit the jackpot at a Monaco casino. In February 2017, an 89-year-old British woman won almost $2 million on a single spin of the roulette wheel. While luck no doubt plays a part in such spectacular wins, it’s also important to have a little bit of knowledge about the game you are playing. So if you’re feeling lucky and fancy giving roulette a go yourself, read on for our top tips on how to increase your chances of winning big. 

# Bet on black or red – This is by far the simplest and most common strategy for betting on roulette, and it’s one that even novice players can use successfully. All you need to do is place your chips on either black or red and wait for the wheel to spin – Simple! 

# Spread your bets out – When you first start playing roulette, it can be tempting to place all your chips on one number in the hope of hitting the big win. However, this is actually one of the worst things you can do as it significantly decreases your chances of winning. A much better strategy is to spread your bets out across several different numbers instead. 

# Know when to walk away – This is especially important when playing roulette, as it’s easy to get carried away and start betting larger sums of money in an attempt to recoup losses. However, if things aren’t going your way and you start losing money fast, it’s best to just walk away before you lose any more. There will always be another day to try your luck at roulette!

#  Expert Casino Player Hits Jackpot With Typical Shot Roulette Strategy 

A professional casino player has hit a major jackpot with a surprisingly simple strategy - playing Shot Roulette.

The player, who wishes to remain anonymous, has been playing Shot Roulette for years and has always relied on taking the same shot to win. This shot, according to the player, is extremely simple and almost always guarantees a win.

"I know the game well and I know that the odds are in my favour when I take this particular shot," said the player. "I'm not sure why more people don't play this way, it's so simple and it works!"

Indeed, the Shot Roulette strategy does seem simple enough; all the player does is wait for the ball to drop into one of the numbered pockets and then take a corresponding shot. However, as any experienced casino player knows, simplicity is not always a guarantee of success. So what is it about this particular shot that makes it so successful? 

According to experts, there are two factors that make this shot so successful. Firstly, the Shot Roulette strategy takes advantage of the fact that the ball drops at different speeds into different pockets. By taking your shot quickly after the ball has dropped, you can ensure that you are taking your chance with momentum on your side. 

Secondly, by aiming for one of the outer pockets rather than one of the central pockets, you are dramatically increasing your chances of winning. This is because there are far fewer combinations of numbers which will result in a win when betting on one of the outer pockets. 

So if you're looking to up your chances of winning at Shot Roulette, why not try out this simple but effective strategy?
