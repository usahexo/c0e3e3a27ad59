#  Wilson students figure out how to beat casino game 

Wilson students have figured out a way to beat the casino game blackjack. The students, who are mostly math and computer science majors, say they were able to develop a computer program that allows them to win nearly 60% of the time they play the game. 

The students refused to divulge how the program works, but say they are able to take advantage of a flaw in the casino software. “It’s not that casinos are stupid or anything, but the programmers who design these games don’t necessarily have an advantage player in mind when they write the code,” said one of the students involved in developing the program.

The program is apparently so successful that the group of Wilson students has turned into a sort of blackjack team, making regular visits to Atlantic City and other gambling hotspots to ply their trade. In fact, on one recent trip to Atlantic City, the team walked away with over $15,000 in winnings. 

While some might see this as cheating, the students involved maintain that they are simply taking advantage of a loophole in casino software – something that is allowable under casino rules. “I don’t see anything wrong with it,” said one student. “We’re just using our knowledge of mathematics and computer science to beat the system.”

#  Student's Wilson casino game strategy revealed 

A group of computer science graduate students from the University of Waterloo have blown the lid off a popular casino game, revealing the underlying strategy used by some players to win more often than not.

The game in question is called Wilson, a blackjack variant where players are dealt two cards and must choose whether to hit, stand, or double down. The graduate students discovered that by doubling down on 11 and splitting 8s and 9s, a player can statistically increase their chances of winning by almost 20%.

"Wilson is a challenging but fun game," explains one of the students involved in the study. "We were curious about what the best strategy was, so we spent some time analyzing the data. We were surprised to find that doubling down on 11 and splitting 8s and 9s are actually the most profitable moves."

The findings have generated a lot of interest in the gambling community, with many players looking to put the new strategy to the test. Whether it will work in practice remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure – this is definitely one casino game that is no longer impenetrable.

#  Via students crack casino game code, win big 

For many students, the allure of gambling is hard to resist. For a few lucky students at Atlantic City’s Stevens Institute of Technology, that meant cracking the code to a popular casino game and walked away with some serious winnings.

The game in question was Unlimited Blackjack, where players are given an unlimited amount of guesses to find the right cards to make a blackjack hand. The code-cracking students were able to figure out the algorithm used by the casino to determine the best move for each player, allowing them to essentially beat the house and walk away with over $1,000 in winnings.

While it’s not clear exactly how they did it, one of the students involved in the exploit described it as a “simple mathematic equation” that they were able to brute force given enough time. And given that blackjack is a game that heavily favors the house if played perfectly, this small victory is sure to make waves in the online casino world.

As for the students involved, they say they plan on using their ill-gotten gains to pay for tuition and other school expenses. Not a bad haul for a few days work!

#  How to win at casino games, according to Wilson students 


Casino games are popular around the world and can be a lot of fun. However, many people don’t realize that there is a strategy to winning these games. Wilson students weighed in on the best ways to win at casino games.

For blackjack, the most important rule is to always stand on 17 or higher. This minimizes the house edge and gives you the best chance of winning. Another key strategy is to split 8s and Aces, since both of these cards have a high value.

In roulette, the best bet is to place your chips on red or black. This gives you a chance to win even if the ball lands on a different number. You can also place your chips on one of the columns or on an odd or even number, but these bets have a lower payout and are riskier.

Slot machines can be won by playing max credits and betting on multiple lines. This will increase your chances of hitting a winning combination. Additionally, try to find machines that are labeled as loose slots, as these have a higher payout percentage than other machines.

Bingo is all about having good timing and covering as many numbers as possible. Be sure to mark off your numbers as soon as they are called, since someone else could mark them off if you wait too long. Additionally, cover as many squares as possible in each row and column in order to maximize your chances of winning.

#  Wilson students share winning casino game strategy

This week, Wilson students proved they have what it takes to win big in the casino gaming world.

According to first-time winners Jimmy Nguyen and Stephanie Tran, the key to success is all about strategy. "We stuck to basic blackjack and roulette games, and only bet what we could afford to lose," Nguyen said.

The pair reported hitting a jackpot of $900 on their first trip to the casino, and they weren't the only ones celebrating a win. Other Wilson students also took home sizable payouts from various casino games.

"I was definitely feeling lucky," said senior Danny Pham after winning $500 playing blackjack. "I've been practicing at home so I knew what I was doing."

With odds like that, it's no wonder Wilson students are raking in the profits! If you're looking to try your luck at the casino, be sure to follow these simple tips:

- Stick to games you know how to play
- Bet conservatively and only risk money you can afford to lose
- Remember that Lady Luck is never guaranteed - enjoy yourself no matter what happens!
